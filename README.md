# Fight!
This is an early prototype of a multiplayer networked fighting game, as well as a server for forming lobbbies.

The game is written using Rust and the Bevy game development framework. The web server uses Tokio and Axum, with a PostgreSQL database. Migration management is handled with Sqitch.
